Our stream video/picture is relay on the python picamera, which was developed by Dave Jones.

For this project, we actually do not have to mod the original code at all, however, if you feel like to get to know about its mechanisation
there has some useful information on this page :https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/python/README.md
